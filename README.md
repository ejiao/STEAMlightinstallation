# STEAMlightinstallation

Inside here, there are tests and production code: 

# tests: 
Run these when first connecting various components to the arduino 

rgbMotion - tests motion sensor with the Arduino and LED strips 
rgbSound - tests sound sensors with Arduino and LED strips 
rgbultrasonic - tests sound sensors with Arduino and LED strips 

rgbstriptest - tests full setup of 3 RGB strips - should flash each strip once in each color

# production: 
All files beginning with "rgbThreeStripsUltrasonic" are production-ready 
  Mark I is the first lantern we made - has the lowest voltage requirements
  Mark II is the second lantern we made - has the highest voltage requirements 
 
All files ending with "Breathing" will cause the three light strips to oscillate between bright and dim shades of blue.
